      I am a software engineer with over 3 years of experience in web and mobile
      development. I have a passion for building applications that are
      user-friendly and accessible to everyone. I am always looking for new
      ways to learn and to improve my skills. The Vue.js, Vite, and Nuxt communities
      have been a great source of inspiration for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have used a variety of technologies to build applications, including
      ASP.NET Core, TypeScript, React, React Native, Node.js, Vue.js, and more.
      I have experience working with databases such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and
      MongoDB. I have also worked with cloud services such as Azure and AWS.
      If your project requires a specific technology, I am always willing to learn
      and adapt to new technologies. Also if you're interested in knowing what
      technologies I am currently using, check out my <NuxtLink to="/tools">
        Tools
      </NuxtLink> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a graduate of the University of Technology, Jamaica, where I received a
      Bachelor of Science in Computing with a major in Software Engineering. I
      am currently pursuing a certification in Azure Fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a wide range of interests outside of software development. I enjoy
      reading books, repairing electronics, and learning new technologies.
      Recently, I have been learning about machine learning and artificial
      intelligence as well as relearning Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always looking for new opportunities to work on exciting projects and
      collaborate with other developers. If you have a project that you would like
      me to work on, feel free to <NuxtLink to="/chat">
